# Basic c# habbo image searcher   
Mainly focused for letting people inspect the code how they would grab a habbo user with their ID and then parse for the images, even though it's not the best way made I think this will help a huge portion of the people struggling with creating something like this. Planning to multiple hotel support when I have the time for it(probarly not because I'm really lazy)


Hope I can help someone with this project!
